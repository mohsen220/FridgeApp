# FridgeApp

What you will be able to see here is two template pages (our sign up page and home page), this will provide you with executble code were you can view the 
front end of these two pages. This repository is meant to show you the basic semantics of our application (e.g html and css files) and how we would proceed if we were 
asked to build the entire application. The styling in the css file will be consistent accross all pages.
